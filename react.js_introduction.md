* React allows us to create reusable UI components
* React is not a framework

# Features of React

# How to create React Applications in Local Machine
        * Install Node JS
        * Install create-react-app
        * Generate Project
        * Build Project

* To Download Node Js visit official website https://nodejs.org
* Once download and installation are successful ,To test version of node js installed in your machine use the following command
       
       * node -v        
       * node --version
       
 * Install create-react-app using the following command
       
       * npm install -g create-react-app
       
* Generate Project using the following command

      * create-react-app projectname or npx create-react-app projectname
      
* Once Project is created change directory to project and start the development server

      * cd projectname
      * npm start
      
* By Default React JS will run on PORT :3000 

* When we create new Project using create-react-app the following files and folders are created inside project directory

          * node_modules : Folder that contains all our project dependencies
          * public : Folder that stores static files like images etc
          * src : Folder where we put source code we write
          * package-lock.json : Records the exact version of packages that we install
          * package.json : Records our project dependencies and condifures our project
          * README.MD : Contains Instructions on how to use this project
